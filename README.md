# Design Proposal 
Design proposal is a new way for DAOs to develop their proposals taking advantage of their decentralized nature. The purpose of this dApp is to allow for the DAO 
enable contributors to a certain topic to assemble a proposal that is based on micro votes and independent contributions. At the end of the proposal creation period 
the final agreed sections are presented together for final editing by the originator of the proposal. 

## Features 
The key features of Design Proposal are the following: 
- Proposal Creation - Design proposal enables users to create draft serverless proposals on chain utilising IPFS content addressing to manage large data
- Section Based Voting - Voting on each section contributes to the overall status of the Proposal
- Automated Vote Tally - Votes are tallied autonomously on chain determining the status of the Section and consequently the Proposal
