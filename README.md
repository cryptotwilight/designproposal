# Design Proposal 
Design proposal is a new way for DAOs to develop their proposals taking advantage of their decentralized nature. The purpose of this dApp is to allow for the DAO 
enable contributors to a certain topic to assemble a proposal that is based on micro votes and independent contributions. At the end of the proposal creation period 
the final agreed sections are presented together for final editing by the originator of the proposal. 

Working testnet versions of Design Proposal can be found at the addresses below.
