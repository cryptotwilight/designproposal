Introduction
Design Proposal has been built from the ground up to enable users to permissionless, develop group proposals that have a higher level of quality and rigor than a solitary developed proposal. 
The intent of Design Proposal is to make it easy for users to consume and contribute to emerging proposals, without the need to go through reams and reams of data. 
The service allows users to vote on specific sections of a proposal and provide comments on that section in the context of the vote. 

How to use it 
The steps to use Design Proposal are the following 
1. Connect your Metamask Wallet to the Sepolia Testnet 
2. Browse the existing proposals to select 
3. Brows the sections of the selected proposal 
4. Where the section is still open Vote on the proposal 
5. At the end of the voting period the vote tally will be displayed.
